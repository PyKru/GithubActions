# - Artifacts allow us to share data between jobs in a workflow and store data once that workflow has completed. 
# Common Artifacts Example
# - Log files and core dumps
# - Test results, failures and screenshots
# - Binary or compressed files
# - Stress test performance output and code coverage results

# By Default Github Action stores artifacts for 90 days.
